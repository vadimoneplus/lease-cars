                        <div className="why-lease__context-text_top">Leasing a vehicle is essentially entering into a
                            long term rental
                            agreement for that vehicle. Unlike a traditional car purchase, you donâ€™t actually own the
                            vehicle. Instead, a leasing company purchases the vehicle from the dealer on your behalf and
                            then you make monthly payments to the leasing company for the duration of your lease. Some
                            leases however, do provide the option to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease.
